UI/UX:
Questions:
* How can you use display properties to give your web pages a clean, professional look? 
* How can you leverage techniques like positioning, and spacing and bordering with the box model to enhance the user experience? 
* Can you think of ways that pseudo-class selectors could make it more fun for users to interact with your site?

Considerations:
* Color scheme: the colors you choose communicate a lot to the user. Since you know HEX colors, you have literally millions of options. Most sites choose just three colors for their color scheme. Choose your colors carefully. **Decide based on images chosen**

* Font: font choice can make a huge difference in the look and feel of your website. Many sites choose two fonts: one for content and one for logo and navigation items. Lean into your knowledge of the CSS `font-family` property.

* Visuals: what photos, images and graphics would best serve the user experience youâ€™re creating? Use CSS properties to style different types of visual elements. Hint: get ready to become best friends with width, height, position, display and others.
